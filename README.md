## About Me 

I am a software engineer, brewer, father, doer. One of my strengths is going into every endeavor knowing I do not have experience in it yet, but through grit, desire to learn, thoughtful action, and maybe a little stubbornness I can accomplish whatever I set my mind to. 

Currently I am obsessed with Rails and the magic of Stimulus, Stimulus Reflex, and Cable Ready. I watched this video on Turbolinks that made the complexity of modern front end frameworks and APIs just seem like a comedy about a blind date you went on to Cancun. It sounds great in the beginning and then it gets out of control. 

Honestly I truly just love to code and make cool stuff be that Rails, React, Ruby, Javascript, or whatever new language I get to work with next.
