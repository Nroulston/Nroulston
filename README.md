## About Me 

I am a software engineer, brewer, father, doer. One of my strengths is going into every endeavor knowing I do not have experience in it yet, but through grit, desire to learn, thoughtful action, and maybe a little stubbornness I can accomplish whatever I set my mind to. 

Honestly I truly just love to code and make cool stuff be that Rails, React, Ruby, Javascript, or whatever new language I get to work with next.

- âš¡ Fun fact: [I was on tv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybjn4kynyzk&t=2s) - To this day this is the accomplishment I am most proud of. Helping my father produce this built the base of who I have become. Shout out to the man I lovingly call Dadio!
